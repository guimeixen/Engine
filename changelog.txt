v0.0.4
- It's now possible to add new input mappings per project
- Input mappings are now saved in a file which is global to a project
- When adding an entity the object window now becomes focused. Same thing for terrain, when adding a terrain the
  terrain window becomes focused
- The editor now displays the exit popup if a user tries to close the window by pressing the close button (X),
  instead of closing immediately
- Fixed a bug when clicking on the input mappings window or the exit popup when you close the editor and it would
  also click on the entity behind the window in the game view
v0.0.3
- Added project export using MSBuild
- Fixed input mappings not loading on a standalone build
