v0.0.5
- Material path is displayed if the material name of the material is empty in the Model Component in the Object Window
- Fixed the old/previous texture not being deleted after changing the texture of a material to a new one in the Editor
- Fixed crash when trying to display the name of an empty script entity property in the Editor
- Only select an entity in the Scene Window list when the mouse is released instead of when it's clicked
- Fixed crash when in Play mode if the name of a script property wasn't the same as the script variable name
- Fixed rigid bodies, colliders and triggers not updating on the children of an entity when updating the transform of
  the parent in Editor
- Fixed a bug when adding the same script to more than one entity and if the script had properties that happened to have
  the name of the table/script in it's name (eg. script name pickup and property name pickupText) they would only have the
  correct names on the first script. The second, third and so on would have incorrect names.
  Eg. First script name: pickup, property name: pickupText.
      Second script name: pickup1, property name: pickup1Text
  As you can see the name of the second script needs to be altered and this was also changing the name for every ocurrence
  of the word pickup

  console window and in the script component section of the Object Window

- The editor now displays the exit popup if a user tries to close the window by pressing the close button (X),
  instead of closing immediately
- Fixed a bug when clicking on the input mappings window or the exit popup when you close the editor and it would
  also click on the entity behind the window in the game view
- Fixed a bug with GetAxis and GetAction which would create a new input mapping if it didn't exist when they were
  called
